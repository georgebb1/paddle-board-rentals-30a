README

I'm new here and I want to try Rails 5.1.3 for a new site about [paddle board rentals 30a](http://www.greenebikes.com). I'm a beginner in programming, but I am also a big fan of bikes and outdoor activities, so it is a pleasure to do this. I hope I can create something special that I can be proud of. 

There seem to be so many add-ons that allow you to accomplish anything you want. The only problem is time, and it flies so fast... But anyway, I love working for this client and I'll do my best to create something that can help their business.

I also work in search engine optimization, which is a lot easier to do (especially when you have a lot of experience), but I think it's time to learn something completely new and I have a feeling it will help me a lot in the future. Maybe I'll switch to doing programming for a living in the future, who knows?
